## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is the very first project where I've been using Tailwind CSS.
I learned:

- How to add custom fonts and colors to Tailwind.
- How to use CSS variables in Tailwind.

### Continued development

While there are some intuitive elements in Tailwind, I will need some more practice with it by creating some projects where I can setup entire themes and have more complicated designs.

### Useful resources

- [Adding custom fonts to React](https://dev.to/ziqinyeow/how-to-add-custom-font-file-to-your-react-app-31kb) - This helped me to understand how I should be adding custom fonts into React.
- [Adding Fonts to Tailwind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnBG2wUm1s) - I watched this video to see how you could add the configuration into Tailwind CSS.
- [Adding colors to Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)
